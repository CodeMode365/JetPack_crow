## About the Game
The game is a simple and easy-to-play hunting game where the objective is to hunt down a flying raven on the screen. The player must prevent the raven from passing through the entire screen, otherwise the game will be over. The game is developed using TypeScript and compiled into JavaScript to ensure compatibility with all browsers. To run the game, it is recommended to use a live-server and it runs smoothly on mobile devices, although some modifications may still be required.
